Analysis of the State of IDP Camps in Five States of Northern Nigeria.
The states are Adamawa, Yobe, Taraba, Bauchi and Borno states.

About the data set analysed
This dataset contains only internal displaced persons living in camps and camp-like settlements. During Round 38, site assessments were conducted in 2,380 locations. Assessed locations included 309 camps and camp-like settlements as well as 2,071 locations where internally displaced persons were living among host communities (down from 2,089 in Round 37). The purpose was to better understand the gaps in services provided and the needs of the affected population. Site assessments included an analysis of sector-wide needs, shelter and non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food and nutrition, health, education, livelihood, security, communication and protection.

In response to the need for accurate information on internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Nigeria, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) began implementing the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) project in July 2014. The project is supporting the Government of Nigeria and other humanitarian response partners to conduct IDPs assessments in a systematic way as well as to establish a profile of the IDP population.

This analysis basically was drwan from the survey conducted in 2021 (Round 38)
