In order to ensure an error-free data analysis, the data was cleaned by replacing null values of the continous variables by their different mean values while those of categorical variables were dropped.

This project sought to answer the following questions:

The sum of the following variables: a. Number of Dead b. Minimum Estimated Number of Missing c. Total Number of Dead and Missing
d. Number of Survivors e. Number of Females
f. Number of Males Number of Children

Count of Incident Type

Count of Migration Route- Top 10

Count of Location of Deaths - Top 10

Count of Cause of Deaths - Top 10

Sum of Dead by Region- Top 10

Sum of Minimum Estimated Number of Missing by Region- Top 10

Sum of Dead by Incident Type

Sum of Dead by Cause of Death

Sum of Total Number of Dead and Missing by Coordinates- Top 10

Worthy of note is that 1821 Western Africans suffered casualty by Death or Missing And lots more of insights generated and shown by using the bar graphs.

Note: I sincerely apologise that I did not comment by code perhaps because they are short, simple and self explanatory. Most aided by the attached graphs.
